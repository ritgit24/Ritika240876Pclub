For tasks of Pclub/Spring Camp
TASK-1
I have uploaded my code for task - 1 wherein I have tried to create an interactive and catchy User Interface in my webpage named Space.edu  .
I have used HTML,CSS,JS
API USED : NASA APOD API https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=RVnIAvPuxF862FqAen6dnBSWhCthXIdaMohRowzF
Key features of my webpage : 
Going from top to bottom of the page, I first have a login button wherein I allow my users to enter in their required data in a popup which I would later store in a server.
Each of the buttons next to this leads to a respective domain.
Then I allow the users to read an astronomy fact of that particular date using the API Mentioned above
Tip : You may try to hover over various elements of my webpage
On the left of the screen I have added different topics of general interest and knowledge but I haven't added any links to these topics yet .
Then I have added an " About Me " section which leads to another webpage of mine.
Then I have added a feedback section too which displays the number of times the user clicked yes or no.

I have made this webpage in time constraints so I might have missed on to add some other essential / better features.
